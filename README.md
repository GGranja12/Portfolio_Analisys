## The challenge

Hi! In this page I present a practical tech assignment designed to test my skills in portfolio analysis. Portfolio analysis is a systematic way to evaluate investment portfolios to optimize asset allocation and management. It involves a variety of financial metrics and visualizations to assess the performance and risk of different financial assets.
This challenge was developed within the Ironhack's Data Analytics course and briefly asked the following:

- Perform a series of calculations and create visualizations to analyze a set of financial assets.
- Develop the necessary code to accomplish each of these tasks effectively.
- Demonstrate the ability to apply Python programming skills in a real-world financial context.

## Resources
In this repository you will find the jupyter notebook whith all the useful commands and instructions to perform the provided tasks, as well as the csv files essential to retrieve asset related data.

## Final remark
Enjoy the portfolio analysis and challenge yourself too!
